# Simple React App

This is a simple app written with React to demo some personal approaches to the app's common architecture, file structure, and tools I would usually use on a project.

Since this is not a complete project - please ignore possible missing of some styles, functionality, or polishing.

What is missing and what I will do when have more time:

- return-to-the-beginning button
- testing (Cypress for E2E, Testing Library for integration tests)
- UI polishing
- list of most popular tags somewhere on the left of the app
- `react-router` (when new pages arrive - currently only one page to show)
- scroll to be on the full page width
- error handling with UI notifications

# Running the app

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

# Available online

Currently it is available on github pages:
